id="abstract"></a>Abstract<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#abstract" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is a design document providing
information to the Bitcoin community, or describing a new feature for
Bitcoin or its processes or environment. The BIP should provide a
concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the
feature.</p><p>We intend BIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into Bitcoin. The BIP
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.</p><p>Because the BIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal.</p><p>This particular BIP replaces BIP 1 with a more well-defined and clear process.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="copyright"></a>Copyright<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#copyright" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>This BIP is dual-licensed under the Open Publication License and BSD 2-clause license.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="bip-workflow"></a>BIP workflow<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#bip-workflow" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The BIP process begins with a new idea for Bitcoin. Each potential
BIP must have a champion -- someone who writes the BIP using the style
and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate
forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The
BIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether
the idea is BIP-able.
Small enhancements or patches to a particular piece of software often
don&#x27;t require standardisation between multiple projects; these don&#x27;t
need a BIP and should be injected into the relevant project-specific
development workflow with a patch submission to the applicable issue
tracker.
Additionally, many ideas have been brought forward for changing Bitcoin
that have been rejected for various reasons.
The first step should be to search past discussions to see if an idea
has been considered before, and if so, what issues arose in its
progression.
After investigating past work, the best way to proceed is by posting
about the new idea to the <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin development mailing list</a>.</p><p>Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a BIP is
meant to save both the potential author and the wider community time.
Asking the Bitcoin community first if an idea is original helps prevent
too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected
based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do
the trick).
It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire
community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to
the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas
where Bitcoin is used.</p><p>Once the champion has asked the Bitcoin community as to whether an
idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft BIP should be presented to
the <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin development mailing list</a>.
This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft BIP to make it
properly formatted, of high quality, and to address additional concerns
about the proposal.
Following a discussion, the proposal should be submitted to the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIPs git repository</a> as a pull request.
This draft must be written in BIP style as described below, and named
with an alias such as &quot;bip-johndoe-infinitebitcoins&quot; until the editor
has assigned it a BIP number (authors MUST NOT self-assign BIP numbers).</p><p>BIP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on both
the initial idea and the BIP before submitting it for review. However,
wherever possible, long open-ended discussions on public mailing lists
should be avoided. Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include:
setting up a separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the BIP
author accept private comments in the early design phases, setting up a
wiki page or git repository, etc. BIP authors should use their
discretion here.</p><p>It is highly recommended that a single BIP contain a single key
proposal or new idea. The more focused the BIP, the more successful it
tends to be. If in doubt, split your BIP into several well-focused ones.</p><p>When the BIP draft is complete, the BIP editor will assign the BIP a
number, label it as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, and
merge the pull request to the BIPs git repository.
The BIP editor will not unreasonably reject a BIP.
Reasons for rejecting BIPs include duplication of effort, disregard for
formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically
unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards
compatibility, or not in keeping with the Bitcoin philosophy.
For a BIP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria.
It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.
The enhancement must represent a net improvement.
The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not
complicate the protocol unduly.</p><p>The BIP author may update the draft as necessary in the git
repository. Updates to drafts should also be submitted by the author as
pull requests.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="transferring-bip-ownership"></a>Transferring BIP Ownership<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#transferring-bip-ownership" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to a
new champion. In general, we&#x27;d like to retain the original author as a
co-author of the transferred BIP, but that&#x27;s really up to the original
author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original
author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following
through with the BIP process, or has fallen off the face of the &#x27;net
(i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to
transfer ownership is because you don&#x27;t agree with the direction of the
BIP. We try to build consensus around a BIP, but if that&#x27;s not possible,
you can always submit a competing BIP.</p><p>If you are interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, send a message
asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the BIP
editor. If the original author doesn&#x27;t respond to email in a timely
manner, the BIP editor will make a unilateral decision (it&#x27;s not like
such decisions can&#x27;t be reversed :).</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="bip-editors"></a>BIP Editors<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#bip-editors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The current BIP editor is Luke Dashjr who can be contacted at <a href="mailto:luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org">luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org</a>.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="bip-editor-responsibilities--workflow"></a>BIP Editor Responsibilities &amp; Workflow<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#bip-editor-responsibilities--workflow" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The BIP editor subscribes to the Bitcoin development mailing list.

-- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics
of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to
allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current
Bitcoin platforms.</li><li>Motivation -- The motivation is critical for
BIPs that want to change the Bitcoin protocol. It should clearly explain
why the existing protocol is inadequate to address the problem that the
BIP solves.</li><li>Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the
specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular
design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that
were considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence
of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or
concerns raised during discussion.</li><li>Backwards compatibility --
All BIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a
section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The BIP
must explain how the author proposes to deal with these
incompatibilities.</li><li>Reference implementation -- The reference
implementation must be completed before any BIP is given status &quot;Final&quot;,
but it need not be completed before the BIP is accepted. It is better
to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on
it before writing code. The final implementation must include test code
and documentation appropriate for the Bitcoin protocol.</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="bip-header-preamble"></a>BIP header preamble<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#bip-header-preamble" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Each BIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble.

BIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where &quot;XXXX&quot; is the BIP number, &quot;Y&quot; is a serial number
(starting at 1), and &quot;ext&quot; is replaced by the actual file extension

all Bitcoin implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a
change in block or transaction validity rules, or any change or
addition that affects the interoperability of applications using
Bitcoin. Standards Track BIPs consist of two parts, a design document
and a reference implementation.</li><li>An Informational BIP describes a
Bitcoin design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to
the Bitcoin community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational
BIPs do not necessarily represent a Bitcoin community consensus or
recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore
Informational BIPs or follow their advice.</li><li>A Process BIP
describes a process surrounding Bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an
event in) a process. Process BIPs are like Standards Track BIPs but
apply to areas other than the Bitcoin protocol itself. They may propose
an implementation, but not to Bitcoin&#x27;s codebase; they often require
community consensus; unlike Informational BIPs, they are more than
recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them.
Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making
process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Bitcoin
development. Any meta-BIP is also considered a Process BIP.</li></ul><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="bip-status-field"></a>BIP status field<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#bip-status-field" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="specification-1"></a>Specification<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#specification-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The typical paths of the status of BIPs are as follows:</p><p><img src="/BIPS_website/bip-0002/process.png"></p><p>Champions of a BIP may decide on their own to change the status between Draft, Deferred, or Withdrawn.
The BIP editor may also change the status to Deferred when no progress is being made on the BIP.</p><p>A BIP may only change status from Draft (or Rejected) to Proposed,
when the author deems it is complete, has a working implementation
(where applicable), and has community plans to progress it to the Final
status.</p><p>BIPs should be changed from Draft or Proposed status, to Rejected
status, upon request by any person, if they have not made progress in
three years. Such a BIP may be changed to Draft status if the champion
provides revisions that meaningfully address public criticism of the
proposal, or to Proposed status if it meets the criteria required as
described in the previous paragraph.</p><p>An Proposed BIP may progress to Final only when specific criteria
reflecting real-world adoption has occurred. This is different for each
BIP depending on the nature of its proposed changes, which will be
expanded on below. Evaluation of this status change should be
objectively verifiable, and/or be discussed on the development mailing
list.</p><p>When a Final BIP is no longer relevant, its status may be changed to
Replaced or Obsolete (which is equivalent to Replaced). This change must
also be objectively verifiable and/or discussed.</p><p>A process BIP may change status from Draft to Active when it achieves
rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a proposal is said to have
rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development
mailing list for at least one month, and no person maintains any
unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive
objections may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have
been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be given in such
circumstances.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="progression-to-final-status"></a>Progression to Final status<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#progression-to-final-status" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>A soft-fork BIP strictly requires a clear miner majority expressed by
blockchain voting (eg, using BIP 9). In addition, if the economy seems
willing to make a &quot;no confidence&quot; hard-fork (such as a change in
proof-of-work algorithm), the soft-fork does not become Final for as
long as such a hard-fork might have majority support, or at most three
months. Soft-fork BIPs may also set additional requirements for their
adoption. Because of the possibility of changes to miner dynamics,
especially in light of delegated voting (mining pools), it is highly
recommended that a supermajority vote around 95% be required by the BIP
itself, unless rationale is given for a lower threshold.</p><p>A hard-fork BIP requires adoption from the entire Bitcoin economy,
particularly including those selling desirable goods and services in
exchange for bitcoin payments, as well as Bitcoin holders who wish to
spend or would spend their bitcoins (including selling for other
currencies) differently in the event of such a hard-fork. Adoption must
be expressed by de facto usage of the hard-fork in practice (ie, not
merely expressing public support, although that is a good step to
establish agreement before adoption of the BIP). This economic adoption
cannot be established merely by a super-majority, except by literally
forcing the minority to accept the hard-fork (whether this is viable or
not is outside the scope of this document).</p><p>Peer services BIPs should be observed to be adopted by at least 1% of public listening nodes for one month.</p><p>API/RPC and application layer BIPs must be implemented by at least two independent and compatible software applications.</p><p>Software authors are encouraged to publish summaries of what BIPs
their software supports to aid in verification of status changes. Good
examples of this at the time of writing this BIP, can be observed in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md">Bitcoin Core&#x27;s doc/bips.md file</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet/blob/master/wallet/README.specs.md">Bitcoin Wallet for Android&#x27;s wallet/README.specs.md file</a>.</p><p>These criteria are considered objective ways to observe the de facto
adoption of the BIP, and are not to be used as reasons to oppose or
reject a BIP. Should a BIP become actually and unambiguously adopted
despite not meeting the criteria outlined here, it should still be
updated to Final status.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="rationale"></a>Rationale<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#rationale" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Why is this necessary at all?</p><ul><li>BIP 1 defines an ambiguous criteria for the Status field
of BIPs, which is often a source of confusion. As a result, many BIPs
with significant real-world use have been left as Draft or Proposed
status longer than appropriate. By giving objective criteria to judge
the progression of BIPs, this proposal aims to help keep the Status
accurate and up-to-date.</li></ul><p>How is the entire Bitcoin economy defined by people selling goods/services and holders?</p><ul><li>For Bitcoin to function as a currency, it must be
accepted as payment. Bitcoins have no value if you cannot acquire
anything in exchange for them. If everyone accepting such payments
requires a particular set of consensus rules, &quot;bitcoins&quot; are de facto
defined by that set of rules - this is already the case today. If those
consensus rules are expected to broaden (as with a hard-fork), those
merchants need to accept payments made under the new set of rules, or
they will reject &quot;bitcoins&quot; as invalid. Holders are relevant to the
degree in that they choose the merchants they wish to spend their
bitcoins with, and could also as a whole decide to sell under one set of
consensus rules or the other, thus flooding the market with bitcoins
and crashing the price.</li></ul><p>Why aren&#x27;t &lt;x&gt;&lt;/x&gt; included in the economy?</p><ul><li>Some entities may, to some degree, also be involved in
offering goods and/or services in exchange for bitcoins, thus in that
capacity (but not their capacity as &lt;x&gt;&lt;/x&gt;) be involved in
the economy.</li><li>Miners are not included in the economy, because
they merely <em>rely on</em> others to sell/spend their otherwise-worthless
mined produce. Therefore, they must accept everyone else&#x27;s direction in
deciding the consensus rules.</li><li>Exchanges are not included in the
economy, because they merely provide services of connecting the
merchants and users who wish to trade. Even if all exchanges were to
defect from Bitcoin, those merchants and users can always trade directly
and/or establish their own exchanges.</li><li>Developers are not
included in the economy, since they merely write code, and it is up to
others to decide to use that code or not.</li></ul><p>But they&#x27;re doing something important and have invested a lot in
Bitcoin! Shouldn&#x27;t they be included in such an important decision?</p><ul><li>This BIP does not aim to address what &quot;should&quot; be the
basis of decisions. Such a statement, no matter how perfect in its
justification, would be futile without some way to force others to use
it. The BIP process does not aim to be a kind of forceful &quot;governance&quot;
of Bitcoin, merely to provide a collaborative repository for proposing
and providing information on standards, which people may voluntarily
adopt or not. It can only hope to achieve accuracy in regard to the
&quot;Status&quot; field by striving to reflect the reality of <em>how things
actually are</em>, rather than <em>how they should be</em>.</li></ul><p>What if a single merchant wishes to block a hard-fork?</p><ul><li>This BIP addresses only the progression of the BIP Status
field, not the deployment of the hard-fork (or any other change)
itself.</li><li>Regardless, one shop cannot operate in a vacuum: if they
are indeed alone, they will soon find themselves no longer selling in
exchange for bitcoin payments, as nobody else would exist willing to use
the previous blockchain to pay them. If they are no longer selling,
they cease to meet the criteria herein which enables their veto.</li></ul><p>How about a small number of merchants (maybe only two) who sell products to each other?</p><ul><li>In this scenario, it would seem the previous Bitcoin is
alive and working, and that the hard-fork has failed. How to resolve
such a split is outside the scope of this BIP.</li></ul><p>How can economic agreement veto a soft-fork?</p><ul><li>The group of miners is determined by the consensus rules
for the dynamic-membership multi-party signature (for Bitcoin, the
proof-of-work algorithm), which can be modified with a hard-fork. Thus,
if the same conditions required to modify this group are met in
opposition to a soft-fork, the miner majority supporting the soft-fork
is effectively void because the economy can decide to replace them with
another group of would-be miners who do not support the soft-fork.</li></ul><p>What happens if the economy decides to hard-fork away from a controversial soft-fork, more than three months later?</p><ul><li>The controversial soft-fork, in this circumstance,
changes from Final to Replaced status to reflect the nature of the
hard-fork replacing the previous (final) soft-fork.</li></ul><p>What is the ideal percentage of listening nodes needed to adopt peer services proposals?</p><ul><li>This is unknown, and set rather arbitrarily at this time.
For a random selection of peers to have at least one other peer
implementing the extension, 13% or more would be necessary, but nodes
could continue to scan the network for such peers with perhaps some
reasonable success. Furthermore, service bits exist to help
identification upfront.</li></ul><p>Why is it necessary for at least two software projects to release an
implementation of API/RPC and application layer BIPs, before they become
Final?</p><ul><li>If there is only one implementation of a specification,
there is no other program for which a standard interface is used with or
needed.</li><li>Even if there are only two projects rather than more, some standard coordination between them exists.</li></ul><p>What if a BIP is proposed that only makes sense for a single specific project?</p><ul><li>The BIP process exists for standardisation between independent
projects. If something only affects one project, it should be done
through that project&#x27;s own internal processes, and never be proposed as a
BIP in the first place.</li></ul><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="bip-comments"></a>BIP comments<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#bip-comments" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="specification-2"></a>Specification<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#specification-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Each BIP should, in its preamble, link to a public wiki page with a
summary tone of the comments on that page.
Reviewers of the BIP who consider themselves qualified, should post
their own comments on this wiki page.
The comments page should generally only be used to post final comments
for a completed BIP.
If a BIP is not yet completed, reviewers should instead post on the
applicable development mailing list thread to allow the BIP author(s) to
address any concerns or problems pointed out by the review.</p><p>Some BIPs receive exposure outside the development community prior to
completion, and other BIPs might not be completed at all. To avoid a
situation where critical BIP reviews may go unnoticed during this
period, reviewers may, at their option, still post their review on the
comments page, provided they first post it to the mailing list and plan
to later remove or revise it as applicable based on the completed
version. Such revisions should be made by editing the previous review
and updating the timestamp. Reviews made prior to the complete version
may be removed if they are no longer applicable and have not been
updated in a timely manner (eg, within one month).</p><p>Pages must be named after the full BIP number (eg, &quot;BIP 0001&quot;) and placed in the &quot;Comments&quot; namespace.
For example, the link for BIP 1 will be <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comments:BIP 0001 · bitcoin/bips Wiki · GitHub</a> .</p><p>Comments posted to this wiki should use the following format:</p><div class="mdxCodeBlock_iHAB"><div class="codeBlockContent_32p_"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_1BYj">Copy</button><div tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_19pQ"><div class="codeBlockLines_2n9r" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">&amp;lt;Your opinion&amp;gt; --&amp;lt;Your name&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Date of posting, as YYYY-MM-DD&amp;gt;</span></div></div></div></div></div><p>BIPs may also choose to list a second forum for BIP comments, in addition to the BIPs wiki.
In this case, the second forum&#x27;s URI should be listed below the primary wiki&#x27;s URI.</p><p>After some time, the BIP itself may be updated with a summary tone of
the comments.
Summary tones may be chosen from the following, but this BIP does not
intend to cover all possible nuances and other summaries may be used as
needed:</p><ul><li>No comments yet.</li><li>Unanimously Recommended for implementation</li><li>Unanimously Discourage for implementation</li><li>Mostly Recommended for implementation, with some Discouragement</li><li>Mostly Discouraged for implementation, with some Recommendation</li></ul><p>For example, the preamble to BIP 1 might be updated to include the line:</p><div class="mdxCodeBlock_iHAB"><div class="codeBlockContent_32p_"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_1BYj">Copy</button><div tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_19pQ"><div class="codeBlockLines_2n9r" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">Comments-Summary: No comments yet.</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">Comments-URI: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0001</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">              https://some-other-wiki.org/BIP_1_Comments</span></div></div></div></div></div><p>These fields must follow the &quot;Discussions-To&quot; header defined in BIP 1
(if that header is not present, it should follow the position where it
would be present; generally this is immediately above the Status

presently regard BIPs as a &quot;good idea&quot; simply by virtue of them being
assigned a BIP number. Due to the low barrier of entry for submission of
new BIPs, it seems advisable for a way for reviewers to express their
opinions on them in a way that is consumable to the public without
needing to review the entire development discussion.</li></ul><p>Will BIP comments be censored or limited to particular participants/&quot;experts&quot;?</p><ul><li>Participants should freely refrain from commenting outside of

Each new BIP
must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. The
License header in the preamble must be placed after the Created header.
Each license must be referenced by their respective abbreviation given
below.</p><p>For example, a preamble might include the following License header:</p><div class="mdxCodeBlock_iHAB"><div class="codeBlockContent_32p_"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_1BYj">Copy</button><div tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_19pQ"><div class="codeBlockLines_2n9r" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">License: BSD-2-Clause</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">         GNU-All-Permissive</span></div></div></div></div></div><p>In this case, the BIP text is fully licensed under both the
OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license as well as the GNU All-Permissive
License, and anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they
comply with the terms of <em>either</em> license. In other words, the license
list is an &quot;OR choice&quot;, not an &quot;AND also&quot; requirement.</p><p>It is also possible to license source code differently from the BIP
text. A optional License-Code header is placed after the License header.
Again, each license must be referenced by their respective abbreviation
given below.</p><p>For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header might look like:</p><div class="mdxCodeBlock_iHAB"><div class="codeBlockContent_32p_"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_1BYj">Copy</button><div tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_19pQ"><div class="codeBlockLines_2n9r" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">License: BSD-2-Clause</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">         GNU-All-Permissive</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">License-Code: GPL-2.0+</span></div></div></div></div></div><p>In this case, the code in the BIP is not available under the BSD or
All-Permissive licenses, but only under the terms of the GNU General
Public License (GPL), version 2 or newer.
If the code were to be available under <em>only</em> version 2 exactly, the &quot;+&quot;
symbol should be removed from the license abbreviation.
For a later version (eg, GPL 3.0), you would increase the version number
(and retain or remove the &quot;+&quot; depending on intent).</p><div class="mdxCodeBlock_iHAB"><div class="codeBlockContent_32p_"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_1BYj">Copy</button><div tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_19pQ"><div class="codeBlockLines_2n9r" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">License-Code: GPL-2.0   # This refers to GPL v2.0 *only*, no later license versions are acceptable.</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">License-Code: GPL-2.0+  # This refers to GPL v2.0 *or later*.</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">License-Code: GPL-3.0   # This refers to GPL v3.0 *only*, no later license versions are acceptable.</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">License-Code: GPL-3.0+  # This refers to GPL v3.0 *or later*.</span></div></div></div></div></div><p>In the event that the licensing for the text or code is too
complicated to express with a simple list of alternatives, the list
should instead be replaced with the single term &quot;Complex&quot;. In all cases,
details of the licensing terms must be provided in the Copyright
section of the BIP.</p><p>BIPs are not required to be <em>exclusively</em> licensed under approved
terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable licenses <em>in addition
to</em> at least one acceptable license.
In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed in the
License and License-Code headers.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="recommended-licenses"></a>Recommended licenses<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#recommended-licenses" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>BSD-2-Clause: <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license</a></li><li>BSD-3-Clause: <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSI-approved BSD 3-clause license</a></li><li>CC0-1.0: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal</a></li><li>GNU-All-Permissive: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html">GNU All-Permissive License</a></li></ul><p>In addition, it is recommended that literal code included in the BIP be
