## So all code changes happen through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively
welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Alternatively you can use the `edit this page` button to edit documentation pages.
3. If you've added code that need documentation, please update the documentation.
4. Make sure your code follows the respective language guidelines as much as possible.
5. Be sure to test your modifications.
6. Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
7. Issue that pull request!
